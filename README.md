##### API Fetched Data
###### In this Python file, I explored fetching data from an API using the requests library. The process can vary depending on whether you need to retrieve data from a single page or multiple pages. Once the data is obtained, itâ€™s converted from JSON format into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis and manipulation. This approach allows for efficient handling of API responses, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases. While the process remains relatively simple, the complexity can increase depending on the structure and size of the data received after calling the API, requiring careful consideration of pagination, rate limits, and error handling.

##### Web Scrapped Data
###### In this Python file, I attempted to scrape product data from Amazon's website, specifically focusing on watches. Using BeautifulSoup, I extracted key information about the watches, such as the title, price, rating, total number of ratings, and material of the watch. The process involved parsing the HTML structure of the Amazon page to locate relevant data elements based on their HTML tags and attributes.

##### Practising Python Concepts
###### This file serves as a practice space for basic Python operations and foundational programming concepts. It is prepared to reinforce understanding of essential Python functionalities through examples. Practiced fundamental operations such as arithmetic, list comprehensions, lambda functions, operations on lists, nested lists, tried matrix multiplication using nested loops, etc.
